After a misunderstanding with the law, Miles questions what it means to be a hero when people are ready to believe the worst of you. Tempted by the power and freedom of his new abilities, Miles must decide what kind of Spider-Man he wants to be. When Vulture starts wreaking havoc across the city with his new accomplice Starling, Miles can't just sit back and watch.
