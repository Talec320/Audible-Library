window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>More Barliona adventures from the best-selling author of the Way of the Shaman LitRPG series! </p> <p>To make a clan does not necessarily mean to make it successful. First you have to walk the hard path from the foundations of your castle to victory in interclan conflicts. Only then will you be recognized. Only then can you be listed among the location's top clans. </p> <p>Your adversaries, however, will not be sitting around twiddling their thumbs. No dominant clan needs yet another wannabe competitor. Or its two founders. Which is why Kvalen and Eradani are being hunted down. Bugles sound as players sharpen swords and draw arrows. Bring on the show!</p> <p>Just one thing - have the contestants accounted for all the factors involved in such a dubious undertaking? For in this equation not all the variables are known.</p>";
