window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>J. Jonah Jameson, the publisher of the <i>Daily Bugle</i>, has denounced Spider-Man from the beginning, convincing New Yorkers to see him as a criminal and a menace. But when a robot attack on Manhattan injures Peter Parker's students and Jameson blames Spider-Man, their feud takes on a personal dimension. </p> <p>As the embittered web-slinger faces further robot attacks, each deadlier than the last, his spider-sense warns that Jameson himself is behind them, possibly colluding with Electro, Alistaire Smythe, or another of Spider-Man's mortal foes.</p> <p>Convinced that his worst critic has become a mortal enemy, Spider-Man declares war on Jameson - a war the publisher is eager to wage. But in their relentless pursuit of victory, they both risk losing everything that matters to them - and may both fall victim to the cataclysmic secret behind the robots. </p> <p>GraphicAudioÂ® Production. </p>";
