window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An investigation into a simple cellular-phone fraud leads both Peter Parker and his alter-ego, the Amazing Spider-Man, to a fiendish plot: using unique counterfeiting equipment and a devastatingly large stock-pile of bombs, someone plans to destabilize the world's economy and destroy several major cities. The mysterious corporation CCRC is involved in this plan - and they have caused trouble in the past for Spider-Man and for the alien symbiote Venom, who has sworn to kill Spidey. </p> <p>Soon both hero and villain learn that the mastermind behind that old trouble and the new danger is none other than Spider-Man's oldest, most dangerous enemy: Doctor Octopus. Now Spider-Man and Venom must put aside their differences and join forces to stop the greater menace of Doctor Octopus before the villain devastates the planet!</p>";
