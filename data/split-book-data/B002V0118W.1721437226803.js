Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.<br> <br> The seals of Shayol Ghul are weak now, and the Dark One reaches out. The Shadow is rising to cover humankind.<br> <br> In Tar Valon, Min sees portents of hideous doom. Will the White Tower itself be broken?<br> <br> In the Two Rivers, the Whitecloaks ride in pursuit of a man with golden eyes, and in pursuit of the Dragon Reborn.<br> <br> In Cantorin, among the Sea Folk, High Lady Suroth plans the return of the Seanchan armies to the mainland.<br> <br> In the Stone of Tear, the Lord Dragon considers his next move. It will be something no one expects, not the Black Ajah, not Tairen nobles, not Aes Sedai, not Egwene or Elayne or Nynaeve.<br> <br> Against the Shadow rising stands the Dragon Reborn...<br> <br> <b>The Wheel of Time®</b><br> <i>New Spring: The Novel</i><br> #1 <i>The Eye of the World</i><br> #2 <i>The Great Hunt</i><br> #3 <i>The Dragon Reborn</i><br> #4 <i>The Shadow Rising</i><br> #5 <i>The Fires of Heaven</i><br> #6 <i>Lord of Chaos</i><br> #7 <i>A Crown of Swords</i><br> #8 <i>The Path of Daggers</i><br> #9 <i>Winter's Heart</i><br> #10 <i>Crossroads of Twilight</i><br> #11 <i>Knife of Dreams</i><br> <br> <b>By Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson</b><br> #12 <i>The Gathering Storm</i><br> #13 <i>Towers of Midnight</i><br> #14 <i>A Memory of Light</i><br> <br> <b>By Robert Jordan</b><br> <i>Warrior of the Altaii</i><br> <br> <b>By Robert Jordan and Teresa Patterson</b><br> <i>The World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time</i><br> <br> <b>By Robert Jordan, Harriet McDougal, Alan Romanczuk, and Maria Simons</b><br> <i>The Wheel of Time Companion</i><br> <br> <b>By Robert Jordan and Amy Romanczuk</b><br> <i>Patterns of the Wheel: Coloring Art Based on Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time</i></p>";
