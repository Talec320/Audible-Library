window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>#1 New York Times bestselling author of the Mistborn series Brandon Sanderson continues the epic adventure he began in Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians.</p> <p>So now you've heard all about me, Alcatraz Smedry, and how I was swept out of my life in your normal world and into the fight against the Librarians (jerks!). After being all heroic and stuff in that tale, I didn’t expect to charge headlong into enemy territory: the Library of Alexandria, where I—and my grandpa and my grouchy bodyguard Bastille and her even grouchier mother and some weirdly gifted cousins—run across the Curators (ghosts who will gladly help you check out a book as long as you don’t mind giving up your mortal soul) and some new nasty Librarians who hate our guts … and would be happy to rip them out for us.</p> <p>But none of that comes close to the horror we will have to face if we succeed in finding what we’re searching for … MY DAD! (DUN DUN DUNNNNNN!)</p> <p>The Scrivener’s Bones is the second book in this action-packed fantasy series for young listeners.</p>";
