She sets off in pursuit with only a pair of oxen and her cowardly old step father Lamb for company. But it turns out Lamb's buried a bloody past of his own. And out in the lawless Far Country the past never stays buried.</p> <p>Their journey will take them across the barren plains to a frontier town gripped by gold fever, through feud, duel and massacre, high into the unmapped mountains to a reckoning with the Ghosts. Even worse, it will force them into an alliance with Nicomo Cosca, infamous soldier of fortune, and his feckless lawyer Temple, two men no one should ever have to trust....</p> <p><i>Red Country</i> takes place in the same world as the First Law trilogy, <i>Best Served Cold</i>, and <i>The Heroes</i>. This novel also represents the return of Logen Ninefingers, one of Abercrombie's most beloved characters. </p>";
