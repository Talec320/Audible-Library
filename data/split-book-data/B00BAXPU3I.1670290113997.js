Brett has won rave reviews for his internationally best-selling novels, including his stunning debut, <i>The Warded Man.</i> </p> <p>A continuation of his epic Demon Cycle series, <i>The Daylight War</i> features Inevera, the wife of Jadir, who took center stage in Book 2, <i>The Desert Spear.</i> In this heart-stopping installment, humanity continues to struggle against the demon plague - even as survivors hold out hope that the Deliverer will save them all. On the night of the new moon, the demons rise in force, seeking the deaths of two men, both of whom have the potential to become the fabled Deliverer, the man prophesied to reunite the scattered remnants of humanity in a final push to destroy the demon corelings once and for all.</p>";
