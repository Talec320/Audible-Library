window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When the mark of the great warhammer Aegis-fang is found branded on the back of a vicious outlaw, Drizzt can no longer merely hope that Wulfgar is safe. The dark elf and his companions set out to find the barbarian once and for all. As they discover pieces of the puzzle their friend's life has become, Drizzt grows only more determined to locate him. As his friends search for him, Wulfgar sails with Captain Deudermont in search of the stolen Aegis-fang, now in the hands of the vile pirate Sheila Kree. But the pirate isn't willing to sit around waiting to be caught. She has other plans. Drizzt, Cattie-brie, Regis, Bruenor, and Wulfgar - the Companions of the Hall - come together for the first time since <i>The Silent Blade</i> in a reunion filled with discovery and adventure. </p>";
