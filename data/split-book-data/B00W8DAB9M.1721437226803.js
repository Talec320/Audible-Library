window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The White Tree</i> (book one): In Mallon, the dark magic of the nether has been banned for centuries. Its users have been driven out or killed. Its secrets lost. </p> <p>But the holy book of the nethermancers has just been found by a boy named Dante. </p> <p>As he works to unlock the book's power, he's attacked in the street. The nethermancers aren't gone—and they want their book back. Caught between death cultists and the law, Dante fights for his life, aided by his growing skills and a brash bodyguard named Blays. Together they're drawn into a centuries-old conflict that brings Mallon to the brink of civil war. </p> <p>Surviving won't be easy. But if they make it out alive, they'll step down the path to becoming two of the greatest warriors the world has ever known. </p> <p><i>The Great Rift</i> (book two): Dante and Blays have averted war against their new home of Narashtovik. But they didn't do so alone. It's time to repay their debts. </p> <p>The norren who helped them remain enslaved by the Gaskan Empire. While arming the norren clans for rebellion, Dante hears one of them is in possession of the legendary Quivering Bow. If he can track down the weapon, it could secure norren independence. </p> <p>But the wheels of war have already begun to turn. As Gask moves to crush the rebellion, Dante and Blays find themselves at the head of a campaign for survival—for norren and Narashtovik alike. </p> <p><i>The Black Star</i> (book three): Narashtovik has been saved—but Dante and Blays' friendship has been destroyed. </p> <p>Blaming the Gaskan king for the loss of his love, Lira, Blays infiltrates the enemy nobility.

If he finds and exposes him, Blays will be executed as a spy. </p> <p>As they squabble, strange lights shine in the east. Harbingers of a long-forgotten threat. If the signs go ignored, Narashtovik will be annihilated by an enemy it never knew it had. </p>";
