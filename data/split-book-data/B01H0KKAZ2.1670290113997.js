window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Dark has nearly consumed the planet. Men and beasts have been stripped of their minds, their bodies twisted to serve the Master's will. Her army now numbers in the trillions and is led by two supreme generals. Even the mages have no power to stop her. Driving the survivors to a last bastion of freedom, she calls for the decimated army to surrender. </p> <p>But mankind stands defiant. </p> <p>From the ashes of nations the people have united, and together they brace for the impending storm. Bereft of retreat or refuge, they hold to a single hope - that the Oracle can destroy the Dark before everyone is slaughtered. Facing the end, the Oracle must rise to her birthright and find that which can cleanse the Earth of darkness. </p>";
