window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Something akin to peace has come to the Underdark. The demon hordes have receded, and now the matron mothers argue over the fate of Drizzt Do'Urden. Even so, it becomes clear to one matriarch after another that while the renegade drow may come and go, Menzoberranzan, the City of Spiders, will crawl forever on. </p> <p>And so Drizzt is free to return to his home on the surface once again. Scores are settled as lives are cut short, yet other lives move on. For the lone drow, there is only a single final quest: a search for peace, for family, for home - for the future. </p> <p><i>Hero</i> picks up where <i>Maestro</i> left off, in a sweeping climax to an epic tale. </p>";
