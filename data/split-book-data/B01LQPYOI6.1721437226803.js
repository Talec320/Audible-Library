It is Li-Dirge who finds leadership thrust upon him. He must challenge the SarpanKum and return his brothers to the path of fraternity. </p><p>\"The Prank\" </p><p>The House of Fire and Mirrors. The Fort and the Sword. Both are Kumma military academies and fierce rivals in the city of Ashoka. The Wrath is the annual competition between the two schools, deciding bragging rights for the next year, but it is the Prank that dictates who laughs last and longest. This year, it is especially important for Rukh, Keemo, Farn, and Jaresh. </p><p>\"A Lesson Learned\" </p><p>Drin Port only wanted a long, tall drink. Many long, tall drinks. When chance brings him the opportunity of a lifetime, will he have the wisdom to take advantage of it? </p><p>\"The Missing Diamond\" </p><p>Rector Bryce is called upon to investigate a missing diamond.
