window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Harry’s back! The even more anticipated third book from the best-selling Fayroll series is here. With even more epic battles, challenging quests and even rarer items. Following on from \"The Road East,\" Harriton’s work has been very well received, and his new bosses are pleased with him. Seemingly everything is going well, as he enjoys visiting Fayroll more and more and spending time with his new girlfriend, Vika.</p> <p>But is everything as it seems? Can things stay so positive with him? After a visit from his ex-girlfriend’s brother and a meeting with Raidion's Security, it seems the real world might be much more of a dangerous place for him than ever before. He will begin to question how deep he is in this whole project, but with support from his new girlfriend and his team working on The Fayroll Times, maybe everything will be fine? However, this is just outside of the game.</p> <p>In the game, he joins \"The Hounds\" on a quest through the Northern Mountains and through the mines filled with terrifying and deadly creatures to continue his quest to find the Dryad Sisters, but not before making even more in-game enemies, meeting royalty and saving kidnapped princesses.</p> <p>Winds of Fate continues the best-selling and ever-popular Fayroll series with the author’s great sense of humor, adventure and storytelling skills. This book carries on developing the Fayroll world and also further develops life in the real world. This story has an equally seductive balance between the real world and virtual world, where both settings smoothly complement each other.</p> <p>Vasilyev is showing how much of a writer he is. Every Fayroll book gets better and better. His characters continue to develop and become more real to the reader. His attention to detail and cinematic descriptions have also developed giving the reader a captivating and entertaining read. Winds of Fate is certainly a boundless mix of action, dialogue, humor and colorful descriptions.</p> <p>Andrey Vasilyev started writing in his late thirties, because, by his own admission, “he ran out of things to read.” However, after his first two books gained nearly instant critical acclaim, he had to give serious thought to giving up his banking career and went on to become one of the top authors in the relatively new, yet insanely popular, LitRPG genre that brings together cyberpunk, classic sci-fi, and fantasy. Fortunately for his readers, who had voted his debut novel More Than a Game the “Best Book of the Year 2014,” he never looked back and continued working on his now-bestselling Fayroll series.</p>";
