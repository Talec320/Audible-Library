Hell-bent on reshaping the world in her own image and with her own ideals, she is willing to commit even the most immoral acts in her pursuit of righteousness. At risk of losing everything he has worked so hard to create, Lee has to find a way to defend the weak against a madwoman whose deranged sense of justice has twisted the limits of the game.&nbsp;</p> <p>To make matters even more difficult, Lee is forced to face these problems while dealing with an increasingly erratic system he doesn't understand and the Goddess of Blood's own strong-willed Herald.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is the third installment of War Aeternus, a popular LitRPG gamelit book that focuses on the adventures of Lee, a regular office worker stuck in a game-like world.</p>";
