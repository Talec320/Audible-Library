window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>All Auric Cain ever wanted was a chance.</b> </p> <p>A chance to prove himself. A chance to take control of his life. A chance to be more than a lowly D-Tier, the lowest of the low, in a world broken by the arrival of an alien, enigmatic being known as The System. </p> <p>And the seemingly endless hordes of Gateborn that accompanied it. </p> <p>But chances are hard to come by in the fallen remains of humanity. A century of decline, of desperate struggle, making just surviving another day challenging enough. Let alone striking out to find and challenge an Ascension Gate. </p> <p>Or in Auricâ€™s case, even getting permission to try. </p> <p>But when he finally takes matters into his own hands, that's when he finally gets his chance. A chance that sets off a chain of events that no one, let alone him, could have ever anticipated. A chain of events that could very well reshape Reality itself. </p> <p>Unless he can find a way to stop it. </p>";
