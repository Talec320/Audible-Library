window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Armageddon Day. That is how history will remember the date when two Overlords clashed amidst the war-torn streets of New Whitehall. The disastrous duel its explosive conclusion wreaked heavy casualties on the two armies present, rendering both the Ishigar Republic and the Lodrak Empire unable to continue to fight. And yet, it was no stalemate. With one Hero defeated and another revealed, the balance of power is sure to shift in the elvish nation’s favor. The Republic’s leaders will surely not hesitate to seize this opportunity, as they had already paid for it in blood and gold. Meanwhile the Lodrak Empire is gripped by unease overnight as their Goddess mysteriously falls silent. </p> <p>Boxxy doesn’t care about any of that at the moment. Mostly because the confrontation with Teresa has left it in a comatose state at a most inopportune time. With the Hero status of its public persona revealed, it will be forced to rapidly adapt and escalate its plans. Whereas before it only had to worry about keeping its true identity a secret, it will now have to worry about its alter ego being targeted. Each chosen of the divines is a controversial figure, and the suddenly revealed Hero of Chaos will surely attract a lot of attention. </p> <p>And, as the shapeshifter’s primal instincts are well aware, too much attention can and will lead to a surprise meeting with Death itself. </p> <p>Content Warning: Profanity, gore, violence, explicit adult content.</p>";
