window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Beat the Demon Lord and save the world? No thanks!</b></p> <p>People always said demons and dragons were horrifying monsters. They didn't warn me they were gorgeous, too.</p> <p>My name is Mal, and ever since I was a boy, I've been treated as a malcontent because of my ability to see magic. For everyone else, magic is proof of the Goddess’ love. To me, it is just a colorful spread of enchantments, cantrips, blessings, and hexes. And any spell I can see, I can break.</p> <p>I had always expected to grow up to be a ditch-digger. Instead, I was dubbed a hero. Heroes are sent out in the wasteland, to slay monsters and to challenge the Demon Lord. It’s a suicide mission. But once I was exiled, I found that the outside world was drastically different from what I had thought. The beautiful women I meet, demons, dragons, and orcs, might be my best shot for surviving the insanity I’ve been thrown into.</p> <p><i>Warning: This novel is not appropriate for all ages; it contains descriptions of violence, unconventional relationships, and limitless adventure.</i></p>";
