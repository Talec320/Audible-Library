window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>So I might be pretty good at this hero business after all.</b></p> <p>My name is Mal. Growing up in The City, I had been taught that a benevolent goddess protected us from the Demon Lord and his legion of horrors. But upon my exile, I learned the world was far larger and more wonderful than I could have ever imagined.</p> <p>Now I’m a squire to Annowan, demon knight and heir to the Throne. I’m also married to an elf, and I have three more weddings waiting for me when I return to Babylon; Gilly the dragonkin, Thalie the orc, and Krencha the goblin are all eager to join my family and announce our intentions to topple The City to the entire empire.</p> <p>But a new mission sends us to Dragon Port, Gilly’s hometown, a city ruled by greed and cutthroat politics. We need to access Velka’s Library, which belonged to Annowan’s long-lost mother and find clues on the Bitch Goddess’s remaining two generals and the dwarven king Reverkar.</p> <p>I’ll need all my wits and skills to survive the library’s cursed and twisting corridors. But with my wonderful wives by my side, I’m sure we’ll succeed.</p> <p><i>This book is intended for mature listeners due to descriptions of violence and unconventional relationships. </i></p>";
