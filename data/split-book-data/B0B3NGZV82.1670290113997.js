window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Becoming the Hero of the Dragon Lands isn't easy. You have to survive a ruthless tournament. However, even after his victory, one he'd earned with sweat and blood, Hadjar's deadly adventure had just begun.</p> <p>The winner gets everything he could ever ask for: accolades, a wreath that symbolizes his greatness, and the Emperor's undivided attention. His duty is to escort the dragon Princess to the Ruby Mountains, the dwarves' homeland. But the wreath isn't what it appears to be . . .&nbsp;</p> <p>It would easily be a match for any slave collar, and is controlled by the \"cute and kind\" princess. Moreover, the path that leads to the mountains runs through the Red Mist Lands, which are the kind of place only a chosen few could ever hope to survive . . .</p>";
