To save the world, we’ll need to slay a mad goddess.</b></p> <p>There are no more generals left to fight over, or shards of divinity for the Bitch Goddess to devour. My wives and I have fought across the width and breadth of Amalgam in our battle against the avatar of greed. We’ve defeated zombies, angels, monsters, and horrors beyond count, every victory bringing us to this, the final battle.</p> <p>When an unexpected offer of aid comes from unlike quarters, my harem and I find ourselves breaking into The City, the Bitch’s bastion. Within the Aurora the rules of reality have been rewritten, all creation bent towards the Bitch’s will. We’ll have to overcome impossible odds and defeat her before the Bitch can remake the world in her twisted image.</p> <p>But with my wives beside me, I know we’ll succeed. The only question is: how do you kill a god?</p>";
