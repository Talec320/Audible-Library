window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When an alien invasion threatens everyone she loves, cybernetic samurai Cat LeBlanc must upgrade her warrior skills, in this thrilling cyberpunk tale.</b></p> <p>The megacity of New Montreal has become ground zero for the Antithesis. Having burrowed deep beneath every continent on Earth, the aliens have emerged in massive waves, destroying all sentient creatures in their path. All that’s standing in their way is the elite vanguard of cyber-samurai determined to stop humanity’s extinction at all costs.</p> <p>Catherine “Cat” LeBlanc has only been a samurai for a week, tackling trials by fire as they erupt with guts, grit, and a lot of explosives. As a warrior-still-in-training, her unorthodox and spontaneous fighting style has saved many lives. Now, with New Montreal recruiting soldiers for war, Cat will be on the frontlines with fellow samurai like pyrotechnic nun Gomorrah; buggy, trigger-happy Grasshopper; and goth public relations specialist Emoscythe Mordeath Noir.</p> <p>Despite her prowess in battle, Cat requires stronger armor and more powerful weapons to defeat the Antithesis’s endless hordes. She also needs to ensure her girlfriend, Lucy, and their “kittens”—the brood of orphans they’ve adopted—are safe. But protecting New Montreal and its citizens requires methods of warfare designed to quickly wipe out as many Antithesis as possible. Is the price of victory worth the potential mass destruction it will leave in its wake?</p> <p><b>The fourth volume of the hit LitRPG sci-fi series—with more than seven million views on Royal Road—now available on Audible and wherever ebooks are sold!</b></p>";
