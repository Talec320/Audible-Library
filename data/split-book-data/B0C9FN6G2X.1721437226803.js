He's spent his entire life without a neural implant, excluded from the Altnet, and now needs to investigate a crime steeped in it.</p><p>Nick will need to rely heavily on his subordinates, the city's elite police Archangels. Unfortunately, the deployment of the new prototype, Ezekiel, is threatening to cause a schism in their ranks if he doesn't intervene.</p><p>Tensions rise almost by the hour while he investigates.
