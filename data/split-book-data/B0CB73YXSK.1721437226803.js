As High Priestess of Philosophia Naturalis, Kadia is granted incredible power and prestige—but also puts her at risk from enemies who seek to use her or harm those closest to her.</p> <p>Kadia must be brave and resilient if she hopes to protect herself and those around her as she embarks on her mission to restore natural philosophy's path by returning honor and stature to her patron's domains within Kaledon.
