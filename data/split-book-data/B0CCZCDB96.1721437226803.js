But I guess that’s what happens when you're focused on avoiding the business end of a baseball bat and not paying attention to where you’re running.</p> <p>To make matters worse, I managed to get myself indentured to some sort of dungeon god.

The world was on the brink of some kind of oncoming apocalypse that my new boss thought I was somehow qualified to stop.</p> <p>In my old life I probably would have lost my mind, but with my beautiful bondmate and a feisty redhead at my side, anything seemed possible. Even delving into a dungeon potentially full of void demons hell bent on devouring the world… or worse… spiders.</p>";
