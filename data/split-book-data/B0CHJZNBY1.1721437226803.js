Or will they simply be another statistic on The Path?</p> <p><b>Don't miss book four of this action-packed fantasy adventure that blends everything you love about LitRPG with </b><b><i>xianxia</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p><b>About the series:</b> This is a mix between LitRPG and <i>xianxia</i>. It's like a car that looks like a LitRPG with dungeons and skills, but the interior and engine are all <i>xianxia</i>. It features a magic system and progression system that are logically and internally consistent, as well as realistic fight scenes and a rational MC.</p>";
