Varic needs an exceptional engineer to fix his ship, and there’s only one person for the job: Mell, the master Aether technician.</p> <p>But first, they have to break her out of prison.</p> <p>Mell has been captured by the Advocates, a group of superpowered vigilantes who dominate their corner of the galaxy. They are led by Starhammer, an invincible champion with a personal obsession with Mell.</p> <p><i>The Last Horizon</i> may be crewed by the greatest heroes in the galaxy, but even they have to be careful with Starhammer.
