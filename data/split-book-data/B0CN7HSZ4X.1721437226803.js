Throughout Aspatria, everyone knows my name, and they’re all talking about just how powerful our team can become.</p> <p>My enemies are taking notice too. After defeating the fabled Slayer in the second dungeon, I know someone is waiting to take their revenge on me. I need to watch my back as we set our sights on the next two dungeons.
