It's a career he's passionate about, and all his plans for life are on track—until he winds up transported to the world of Werifesteria in the body of an infamous warlord, at least.</p> <p>Now all he really wants to do is forget the misdeeds of his alter ego and retire to a life of anonymity with a couple interesting women as his new partners.

Turns out, it's a lot of work!</p> <p>To reach his potential, he'll have to come to grips with the secrets of this mysterious world and the way its magic system functions. Can he find peace in the borderlands? Can he turn his Mastery of the Threads of Power into a fulfilling career as a masseur to the denizens of this fantasy world?
