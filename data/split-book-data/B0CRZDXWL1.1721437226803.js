But first he has to build his stronghold, battle monsters and get to know the beautiful Elven queen Leyathel, among others if get to know means what you think it means…</p> <p>However, there's a slight problem. He has no idea who he is, why he was reborn, or what he’s supposed to do. Mere trifling details that won’t stop a Legendary Lord even if it takes him a little bit to get settled into his new environment!</p> <p><b>This is a 4x LitRPG Harem book with: Levels, War, and a Quest for Domination!</b></p>";
